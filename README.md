# ComputeResearch-comp-7430-
This project is created for Computer Research COMP 7430 using Alpha Zero Algorithm to create Tic-tac-toe and ConnectFour

**PROJECT TITLE:** Tic-Tac-Toe using Alpha zero algortihm 

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:** Alpha zero algorithm is a game playing algorithm using machine learning techniques to play board games like Super Human Level. 

**TECHNOLOGY USED:**  Python and pytorch 

**INSTALLATION:** jupyter notebook 

# Step to run : 
1. Run the file `TicTacToe.ipynb`
<br />  Play against computer (1 on 1)

2. Run the file `MCTS.ipynb`
<br /> Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI that uses the MCTS algorithm to make decisions

3. Run the file `model.ipynb`
<br /> Implemented deep neural network model called ResNet

4. Run the file `Alpha MCTS.ipynb`
<br /> Defines the game rules for Tic-Tac-Toe and implements a neural network model using PyTorch for learning and decision-making

5. Run the file `Alpha SelfPlay.ipynb`
<br /> It plays multiple times  

6. Run the file `AlphaTrain.ipynb`
<br /> After playing multiple time it choose best possible way to win the game
